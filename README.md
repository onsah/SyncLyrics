Download the `.deb` package from [here](https://github.com/onsah/SyncLyrics/releases)

Run
```
sudo dpkg -i package.deb
```

### From Source

#### Dependenices
Make sure these are installed before proceeding to install

* cargo
* rustc
* meson
* libgtk-3-dev
* libglib2.0-dev
* libglib2.0-dev-bin
* libdbus-1-dev
* libssl-dev
* libcairo2-dev
* libpango1.0-dev
* libatk1.0-dev
* libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev

Sometimes `cargo` may be out of date therefore build may fail. If you want to get latest `cargo` and `rustc` as debian package you can add the ppa from [here](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-security/+archive/ubuntu/rust-updates)

If you are on an Ubuntu based distro, you can just run the following 
```
sudo apt install meson build-essential libglib2.0-dev libglib2.0-dev-bin libdbus-1-dev libssl-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libatk1.0-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev cargo rustc
```

```
meson build --prefix=/usr
cd build
ninja
